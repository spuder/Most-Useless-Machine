/*
  State change detection (edge detection)
 	
 Often, you don't need to know the state of a digital input all the time,
 but you just need to know when the input changes from one state to another.
 For example, you want to know when a button goes from OFF to ON.  This is called
 state change detection, or edge detection.
 
 This example shows how to detect when a button or button changes from off to on
 and on to off.
 	
 The circuit:
 * pushbutton attached to pin 2 from +5V
 * 10K resistor attached to pin 2 from ground
 * LED attached from pin 13 to ground (or use the built-in LED on
   most Arduino boards)

const int ledPin = 13;       // the pin that the LED is attached to

// Variables will change:

  // initialize the LED as an output:
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
  // initialize serial communication:
  Serial.begin(9600);

  // turns on the LED every four button pushes by 
  // checking the modulo of the button push counter.
